# Open Grant Proposal: `Tokenized Research`

**Name of Project:** `Tokenized Research`

**Proposal Category:** `app-dev`
**Proposer:** `dabhunt`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** Yes

# Project Description

Tokenized Research seeks to utilize distributed ledger technology to open up new avenues for providing trust in the academic process through data integrity and new methods to incentivize scientific research in a far more transparent and democratic way. 
Currently the meta processes that govern how research is conducted and incentivized are highly centralized and have not yet taken advantage of the potential improvements that can be made in this industry by using distributed ledger technology.
Our project focuses on 2 primary use cases of DLT
 1. Ensuring research data integrity via trustless file version management
 2. Providing new kinds of incentives using NFT's and cryptocurrencies to help encourage more research 
## Value
This table is an overview of our value proposition for each involved party
| Universities | Researchers | Research Participants | Filecoin & Hedera Ecosystem |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - Save money by giving out a percentage of participant rewards in Research coin, and reducing transaction fees from fewer gift card purchases
- Verifiably trustworthy data from researchers
 | - Access to a larger pool of research participants
- Able to prove their data has not been manipulated
- Enhanced study funding from Recerca grants
 | - Cryptocurrency based incentives to participate in research
- Social / Gamified NFT based incentives to participate in research
| - Proof of concept for trustless file version management of research data/documents
- Proof of concept for preventing data manipulation in research
- Proof of concept for Social NFTs used to promote a common good(research)
- UCIPT expansion of services to universities nationwide
|

Please describe in more detail why this proposal is valuable for the Filecoin ecosystem. Answer the following questions:
"What are the benefits to getting this right?"
There a number of benefits to both the Filecoin and Hedera ecosystems from this project.
1) Real world proof of concept for using Filecoin and Hedera technologies to provide distributed (trustless) version management of research documents to mitigate data fraud.
2) Proof of concept utilizing social NFT incentives for participating in research, in the form of collectible game-like NFTs, in addition to cryptocurrency incentives.
3) Introduces researchers, Universities, and research participants to the value of distributed ledgers and establish Hedera and Filecoin branding
"What are the risks if you don't get it right?"
If we fail to execute quickly and effectively, competitors may eventually arise with a similar vision for how distributed ledgers can evolve scientific and academic research.
Another risk lies in the regulatory hurdles in research and cryptocurrency. 
We have identified the follow regulatory concerns
- HIPPA regulations in regards to data privacy in research
- Any public sale of cryptocurrency requires registration, and we want to avoid Recerca being categorized as a security.
- Buying, selling, or trading of cryptocurrency within the app would make us responsible for a taxable event 
Our strategy is to err on the side of caution, and seek counsel from our connections in Crypto Projects and academia when we are unsure how we should proceed.

"What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?"
The biggest hurdles in executing this project are mostly surrounding the existing legal framework for how research is currently conducted, and getting enough Universities & Researchers interested in participating.
Research data is also often sensitive information, and HIPAA requires that data to be stored in a very specific way so that personally identifiable information is not public.
As director of University of California Institute for Predictive Technology, Dr. Sean Young plays a key role in guiding our efforts based on his knowledge from past research experience. Additionally, his connections in academia are crucial to onboarding 
our initial Researchers and Universities. 

## Development Roadmap
This section should be 1-3 paragraphs long.

## Deliverables

Please describe in details what your final deliverable for this project will be. Include a specification of the project and what functionality the software will deliver when it is finished.

Our final deliverable MVP will function as follows:
File version management for researchers to store research documents using filecoin distributed storage, and hedera as a trustless 3rd party to prove files have not been modified.
A user facing application for research participants with 5 primary interfaces: 
[Proposal Slides] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zq0RlIAg3asJZ6MYFpMUpAHaezFOZFVuwKkL8djo1uM/)
1) A tab for managing the studies you are currently participating in (Slides 16-23)
2) A tab for finding new studies to participate in (Slides 29-30)
3) A tab for tracking the cryptocurrency/NFT rewards you have earned from participating in research (Slides 31-38)
4) A tab for searching existing studies (Slides 39-40)
5) A way for users to view the version history of a document and verify research data/documents have not been modified. (Slides 24-28)
 
## Development Roadmap

Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section).

For each milestone, please describe:
- The software functionality that we can expect after the completion of each milestone. This should be detailed enough that it can be used to ensure that the software meets the specification you outlined in the Deliverables.
- How many people will be working on each milestone and their roles
- The amount of funding required for each milestone
- How much time this milestone will take to achieve (using real dates)
